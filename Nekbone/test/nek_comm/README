This is an example demonstrating the nekbone
communication suite.
It is just the communication tester
found in nekbone proper.

It has no geometric setup and uses only
the mpi-communication routines in the 
source code.

This example can only be ran in parallel.

It is set by changing PPLIST in makenek 
to equal NEKCOMM
