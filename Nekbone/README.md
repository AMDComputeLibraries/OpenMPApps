Nekbone
=======

Nekbone solves a standard Poisson equation using a conjugate gradient iteration with a simple or spectral element multigrid preconditioner
on a block or linear geometry. It exposes the principal computational kernel to reveal the essential elements of the algorithmic-
architectural coupling that is pertinent to Nek5000.
